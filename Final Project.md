# Introduction

This project consist on the testing of a possible change to the way users enroll on the 15 day trial to any course in the Udacity website. The data I am going to use it is not the real one, but an adaptation with the same results. The technique I am going to use to demonstrate if this change really helps or not is A/B testing. For that we are going to have data from multiple users, differentiated into two groups. The control group is going to be people with the old interface, and the experiment group with the new changes applied. This way we are going to compare the results gathered and make a decision based on if these new changes actually help the Udacity users. The data is composed of the page views received, the number of click in the "Start Free Trial" button, the number of people to finalize the enrollment and finally the number of users to start paying for the course (first month at least). We only used the users who paid at least the first month because A/B test are generally fast, and finalizing a course is longer than the calculated time we will see the Duration vs Exposure section.

# Experiment Design

The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.
The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.

## Metric Choice

For this project had these features available to choose to be either our invariants or evaluation metrics:

* Number of cookies
* Number of user-ids
* Number of clicks
* Click-through-probability: Number of user-ids to enroll divided by the number of unique cookies.
* Gross conversion: Number of user-ids to enroll divided by the number of unique cookies to click in the "Start Free Trial" button.
* Retention: Number of user-ids to make at least one payment divided by the number of users to enroll.
* Net conversion: Number of user-ids to make at least one payment divided by the number of unique cookies to click in the "Start Free Trial" button.

Before starting reasoning why each metric is which, we are going to give some general rules about how to choose each metric. For invariant metrics they should happen before the change introduced by the experiment, therefore they should not influenced by it. Finally for evaluation metrics must have the opposite conditions.

The Number of Cookies wasn't chosen to be an evaluation metric given that it provides little information just by itself to be able to see if the experiment is taking any effect. However as an invariant it provides the possibility to make sanity check because the evaluation metrics rely on this and it is a population sizing metric. 

The Number of User-ids doesn't provide any information alone and also we already have a population sizing metric that measures better the number of people to interact with our test. It could have been a good evaluation metric given that it could keep track of part of the hypothesis but it is not the best metric.This is due to the fact that it is not normalized like Gross or Net Conversion which we will talk in the following paragraphs.

The Number of Clicks has been chosen to be an invariant metric because it directly affects the evaluation metrics so this provides a good way to measure the population sizing. I haven't considered it to be a possible evaluation metric given that it doesn't provide enough information by itself to decide if we have achieved our objective. 

The Click-through Probability has been chosen to be an invariant metric and not evaluation for the following reasons. First, It was chosen to be an invariant given that the probability it it not affected by the change which is an indicator of good invariant from what we said in the previous paragraphs. Second, it wast chosen as a invariant given that it didn't give any new information or possible control due to the fact that it is just a relationship between the already chosen invariants.

The Gross Conversion has been chosen as an evaluation metric because it gives you a good proportion of users that enroll given the number of clicks. It is a good way to measure "how many users go down the funnel". It wasn't chose to be an invariant given that it was a really good evaluation metric. In order to launch the experiment we must look for an decrease in the experiment results.

The Retention seemed to be a great evaluation metric. However, after some calculations I found out that in order to use this metric we would have needed more than 3 months of study, which for an A/B test is too much time. It wasn't chosen to be a invariant metric given that it isn't a population sizing metric and it is a metric that we expect to change.

Finally the Net Conversion was chosen to be an evaluation metric because it gives great insight about the engagement of the users to the course by measuring the proportion of users to keep working on the course past 14 days by the number of clicks. Also I didn't considered to be a invariant metric given that we expect it to change and it isn't a population sizing metric. In order to launch the experiment we are looking for an increase or no decrease in the experiment results. 

To sum up the invariant and evaluation metric choices are the following:

* Invariant: Number of Cookies, Number of Clicks and Click-through Probability
* Evaluation: Gross Conversion and Net Conversion


## Measuring Standard Deviation

The standard deviations for the evaluation metrics are the following:

* Gross Conversion: 0.0202
* Net Conversion: 0.0156

The formula to calculate these results was the following:

 >$\sqrt{\frac{P_1*(1-P_1)}{N}}$

For the Gross and Net Conversion we applied the analytical estimate given that the unit of analysis (values of the denominator) for both metrics in the control and experiment groups are the same.

## Sizing

### Number of Samples vs Power

For this project I wont be using the Bonferroni correction. The reasons can be seen in the Summary section.
Now we have to calculate the number of page views needed for the project to develop. For that we are going to use [this](http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html) on-line calculator. We have to provide the baseline conversion rate, in our case the Probability of enrolling given click and the Probability of payment given click, separately. The minimum detectable effect, which was provided to us. The $\beta$ and the $\alpha$ which were provided too. Due to the fact that we are not going to use Bonferroni we don't need to calculate individual alphas for each evaluation.

Once we got the sample sizes from the calculator we need to extrapolate these results because the inputted data was for 40000 cookies. Once I did that we found that the necessary sample size was: 685275 page views.

### Duration vs Exposure

Now that we know the number of page views needed we can decide how many days we are going to invest in gathering this data. One thing I have to decide is how much of Udacity's traffic we will be using. For this case and given that this test doesn't pose any risk I decided to use 100% of Udacity's traffic. The risk has been reasoned based on these two questions:

* Are we going to work with sensitive data?
* Is anyone going to get hurt by the duration of the experiment?

For this experiment we are not going to use any sensitive data, because the only thing linked to the user is its id which is not relevant not sensitive information, the rest is just aggregated behavioral data. Regarding the second question the change we are testing has so minimal impact in the users cycle through the page that there is no reason to think that any user might get hurt because of it.

So known the percentage of traffic we are going to be using and the number of page views needed we know know that to gather the necessary data we are going to need 18 days.

# Experiment Analysis

## Sanity Checks

In order to see if the work we have been doing is correct we are going to exercise a sanity check in the invariant metrics. For that we are going to compute a 95% confidence interval for the value we expect to observe. So the sanity check will pass if the observed data falls into the confidence interval.

The results calculated are the following:

|                   | Lower bound | Upper bound | Observed |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Number of cookies |    0.4988   |   0.5012    |   0.5006 |
| Number of clicks  |    0.4959   |   0.5041    |   0.5005 |

As we can see both observed values fall inside the interval. This means that the sanity checks for both invariant metrics pass.

## Result Analysis

### Effect Size Tests
For this part we are going to check if our evaluation metrics are statistically and/or practically significant. In order to do that I computed a 95%confidence interval around the difference between the experiment and the control groups.

The results obtained where the following:

|                   | Lower bound | Upper bound | 
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Gross Conversion  |   -0.0291   |   -0.012    |
| Net Conversion    |   -0.0116   |   0.0019    |

In order to see if each metric is statistically and/or practically significant we need to follow these rules:

* A metric is statistically significant if the confidence interval does not include 0 (that is, you can be confident there was a change)
* A metric is practically significant if the confidence interval does not include the practical significance boundary

Knowing these rules I established that the Gross Conversion is both statistically and practically significant.
The Net Conversion was found to be neither statistically nor practically significant.

### Sign Tests

In order to check if the previous results are accurate we are going to work with the day-by-day data, by calculating the p-value. The results should show the evaluation metrics that are statistically significant, and the should coincide with the results from the Effect Size Tests.

|                   |   p-value   |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Gross Conversion  |    0.0026   |
| Net Conversion    |    0.6776   |

The rule in this case to know if it is statistically significant is to check if it is lower than the probability. Which in this case is 0.5.
Knowing these we can establish that the only statistically significant evaluation metric is the Gross Conversion.

### Summary

For this project I didn't use the Bonferroni correction given that the two evaluation metrics are likely covariant. The Bonferroni correction works really well for multiple invariants that are not related given that in that case it tends to be too "conservative" and could have lead to future problems in the project. In addition I started the project using the Bonferroni correction due to that the number of days needed to gather the necessary page views increased to around 120 days which is too much for an A/B test.

More importantly This experiment will launch when all the evaluation metrics reject the null thus Bonferroni would help in this regard given that its primarily objective is to reduce the risk of Type I error, which in this case doesn't exactly apply. To clarify a Type I error consist in the rejection of the null by pure chance, this is dangerous when we set an experiment that will launch if any of our metrics rejects the null. As said before our experiment is design to be launched only when both evaluation metrics reject the null successfully.

## Recommendation

Given the results obtained I would recommend launching the experiment. Due to the fact that both evaluation metrics behaved just as we were expected to. In the case of the Gross conversion it decreased as expected proving its statistical significance. In addition the Net conversion didn't show any decreasing tendency which means that the change would influence negatively on it. I must say that it would have been better to the experiment if the Net Conversion showed an increase, however it wasn't imperative that increase therefore rejecting the null too.



# Follow-Up Experiment

The objective of the experiment is to reduce the number of early dropouts from desperate users. The experiment I would conduct is an alteration to the quiz solver,because it is the place where the user might get desperate. This alteration would be the appearance of a message once the user has tried to solve the quiz more than 5 times for example.  The message would contain a text such as this:

 >"Don't desperate you are not alone! 
 >Go to the forum to look for answers!"

The objective with this message is to remind the users to look in the forum for answers to theirs questions.

The hypothesis for the experiment is that this might ease the desperation of the users in their look for the right answer therefore reducing the number of early dropouts. This is a close adaptation of the previously stated objective that not only should reduce the number of dropouts but increase the participating members in the forum.

The metrics that I would use for the realization of the project are:

* Number of lessons passed: A count of all the lessons that have been passed
* Number of participation in the forums:
* User-ids: in order to keep track of all the users active.
* Number of clicks in the forums link: in order to measure the number of people getting in to get help
* Number of moths payed: Number of payments done
* Ratio of number of clicks in the forum divided by the number of months payed. This could be a great evaluation metric and we would expect an increase to reject the null

For invariant metric I would use the number of enrollments a a population sizing metric.

Finally the unit of diversion should be the user-ids given that it is the unique key in the experiment. In addition it is a great way to track the users better than the cookie or something else because in order to access the course content one must be logged in.
